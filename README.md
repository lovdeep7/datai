# datai
Datai is a smart contract built on Ethereum that allows users to securely submit data using zk-SNARK (zero-knowledge) proofs, while ensuring their identity remains private. The data is stored off-chain on IPFS, and the contract only stores the IPFS hash on-chain. Users are rewarded for submitting valid data, and they have the ability to revoke access to their data at any time. Additionally, the contract implements bot prevention mechanisms, such as a cooldown period between submissions and a minimum gas price requirement.

To further enhance security, the contract includes a stake mechanism. Before submitting data, users are required to deposit a stake, which is locked for a specified period. This ensures that users have a financial commitment when interacting with the contract, discouraging bots and spam. After the cooldown period, users can withdraw their stake. The combination of zk-SNARKs, IPFS storage, bot prevention, and staking creates a privacy-preserving and secure system for submitting and managing data.
